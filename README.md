# real-time-face-pixelation-opencv
Real-time face detection and pixelation using OpenCV and Haar cascades. A beginner-friendly image processing project that anonymizes faces captured by webcam video stream.

Focus Timer Feature:

Focus Timer — Track Your Real Work Time
This project now includes a Focus Timer that tracks how long you actually stay focused in front of your webcam within the privacy zone (center of the screen).

How it works:
    When your face appears in the center area, the timer starts counting your focus time.
    If you leave the zone, the timer pauses and accumulates the total time.
    When you quit the program, it shows how many hours, minutes, and seconds you were focused during that session.

Why is this useful?
    This feature can help you monitor your productivity, especially during study or work sessions, by providing a simple way to measure actual “on-camera” focus time.
